            Review PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} thoroughly.

            First, run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see the changes.

            Then for each changed file, analyze:
            1. **Summary**: What does this change do?
            2. **Security**: Any security concerns (auth, injection, secrets)?
            3. **Bugs**: Logic errors, edge cases, error handling?
            4. **Style**: Consistency with codebase patterns?
            5. **Improvements**: Suggestions for better approaches?

            Be specific. Reference line numbers.

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT try to post comments using `gh pr comment`. Instead, output your complete review directly as your final response. The GitHub Action will automatically post it as a PR comment.

            Format your review with clear markdown sections and provide an overall recommendation (approve, request changes, or comment).
